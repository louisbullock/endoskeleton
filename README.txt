==================================================

BareBones is an assortment of CSS and JS files ready to help fast development and design of websites, all of it neatly packaged and prepared to be used out-of-the-box.

The inner workings of BareBones have been inspired by the wonderful works such as Twitter's Bootstrap, the famous 960 Grid System, the ever so handy HTML5 Boilerplate, and a personal favourite of mine, the Skeleton Grid.

Design-wise, BareBones is designed with a responsive/adaptive grid, so it'll make your site look great on practically all devices, ranging from huge 27" iMacs, to your average 17" laptop, all the way down to a good ol' iPhone.

Not to mention, the design is dead-simple, designed with legibility and contrast in mind (following the fundamental graphic design principles), and keeps up with typographical standards.

The main idea behind BareBones is that it's meant to be a starting point, a grid + toolkit to kickstart your ideas, and to give beginners a foundation to build upon.
