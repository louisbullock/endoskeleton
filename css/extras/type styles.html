<p>The typography of BasicTheme is designed with a strong hierarchy in mind, yet is kept simple and maintains legibility. The base font is the very Swiss-looking typeface Helvetica Neue (Except all you <span class="caps">PC</span> suckers will get crappy ol' Arial) and can be changed to suit if needed.</p>
<p>Regular paragraphs are set at a 14px base, with a 20px baseline (line-height in <span class="caps">CSS</span>)</p>
<p>An ideal measure for 14px sized text is 420px wide, which could be considered when designing your site. The closest BasicTheme has to a 420px wide column is <code class="prettyprint">.six.columns</code>, which is approximately 430px, but can be changed accordingly.</p>

<h1>&lt;H1&gt; is for big, eye-catching headings.</h1>

<h2>&lt;H2&gt; is for light yet important headings.</h2>

<h3>&lt;H3&gt; is for smaller headings.</h3>

<h4>&lt;H4&gt; is a bolder version of &lt;H3&gt;.</h4>

<h5>&lt;H5&gt; is for smaller, quieter headings.</h5>

Glorious paragraphed text! While you're here, highlight the text, it'll look like you went over it with a yellow highlighter marker.

Monocle Magazine presents capital letters as if they were small caps like this: <span class="caps">LRB</span>, which is a little odd, but they make it look fancy.

A fancy ampersand looks like this: <span class="amp">&</span>.

You can do fancy unicode characters like this <span class="uni">&hearts;</span>. I typed in <code class="prettyprint">&lt;span class="uni"&gt;&amp;hearts;&lt;/span&gt;</code> for it to work.

Pretty cool huh? Pretty darn neat, I reckon.
