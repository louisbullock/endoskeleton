# Endoskeleton

### What is Endoskeleton?
Endoskeleton is an assortment of CSS and JS files ready to help fast development and design of websites, all of it neatly packaged and prepared to be used out-of-the-box.

It includes a responsive grid, simple typography, clean forms and buttons, delicious CSS styling and more.

The inner workings of Endoskeleton have been inspired by the wonderful works such as <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter's Bootstrap</a>, the famous <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a>, the ever so handy <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, Dan Eden's <a href="http://daneden.me/toast/">Toast framework</a>, and a personal favourite of mine, the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton Grid.</a>

### Design & core ideas
Design-wise, Endoskeleton is designed with a responsive/adaptive grid, so it'll make your site look great on practically all devices, ranging from huge 27" iMacs, to your average 17" laptop, all the way down to a good ol' iPhone.

Not to mention, the design is dead-simple, designed with legibility and contrast in mind (following the fundamental graphic design principles), and keeps up with typographical standards.

The main idea behind Endoskeleton is that it's meant to be a starting point, a grid + toolkit to kickstart your ideas, and to give beginners a foundation to build upon.

### Support
As far as browser support goes, you can be sure that the framework works near-perfectly in modern browsers, but as for the older, more dated ones, you can expect support will be lacking. To soften the impact, I've added optional script links in the HTML to support HTML5's elements in IE, and support CSS3 media-queries:

- css3-mediaqueries.js (for css3 media-query support)
- html5.js (to give IE support for HTML5's newly introduced elements)

It's up to you whether you want to support older browsers, and it's purely up to you how you go about supporting them.

Even if media-queries aren't supported in a specific browser of your choice, it'll be served the standard 960 grid, even if it's resized.

And if you really want to get clever, I've added some magical conditional CSS comments that target 'ie' for all versions of Internet Explorer, as well as the specific targets for each (e.g. "ie6", "ie7", "ie8"). This'll have to do for now, until there's a better, fool-proof solution, so bear with me.
